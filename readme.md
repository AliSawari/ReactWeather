this project is based on Udemy's The React Complete Course By Andrew Mead Github.com/andrewjmead

This App Uses Node.js and React library also openweathermap.org  api to fetch the real weather for the user

NOTE: I've added some new features to the app like min temp and max temp so it would appear more alike a real weather app
though, its completely used for practise
feel free to do the same

NOTE : it's still active and needs some requirements
I'll pull up some Docs for it soon
